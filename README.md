ðŸ‘‰ leveraged the power of Server components inside of Next.js 14 and when to use Client components </br>
ðŸ‘‰ Scraped Real Data from the Booking.com website to get real Hotel Booking Details via the Oxylabs Web Scraper API! </br>
ðŸ‘‰ Created a Beautiful UI & UX for our Booking.com clone using the highly Popular Shadcn! </br>
ðŸ‘‰ used Skeleton Loaders with Next.js 14 to show Beautiful loading screens whilst the results are being fetched! </br>
ðŸ‘‰ built a fully responsive site with Tailwind CSS! </br>
ðŸ‘‰ used TypeScript to reduce the overall number of Bugs and Errors </br>
ðŸ‘‰ deployed the final build on Vercel!  ***(loading time is more than 10s , but vercel doesn't support this loading time as a "hobby" account)*** </br>
